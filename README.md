The purpose of the project is to design an internet platform to establish communication between charity centers and benefactors
in order to facilitate communication between benefactors and those in need.
The general mechanism of this system is that charity centers define their needs in the form of a project 
and benefactors choose the item or items that are compatible with their ability and time from among these needs and apply for it. 
Defined projects have specifications and requirements that a philanthropist can find his desired project by searching based on these specifications. 
Then the charity institution can reject or accept his request, 
taking into account the benefactor's conditions.
